## Ideas

### Arcade Shooter (Galaga etc)

### Battery status monitor

### Benjamin Franklin's 13 Virtues app
### Book search

### BTN workouts app

### Calculator

A simple Calculator program with Standard functions or with Scientific functions.  
Basic Arithmetic Operations -> Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide  
Memory Operations -> Save to Memory, Recall from Memory, Clear Memory, Operations History  
Other Operations -> Clear Data (Clears the input area and data from memory)

### Running Calculator - Time, Distance, Pace for your next race

### Calendar app

### Calorie Counter (Weight loss) app

### Chat bot

### Chatroom

### Client-side photo editor (VSCO/Darkroom app)

### Cloud audio player

### Code search

### Collaborative Etherpad Lite like Markdown editor

### Conference app

This web app should give a functionality both for the conference organizer and the participates.
Main features: information on tracks/talks (speaker bio, links to slides), schedule with push notification on the talks that the user choose.

### Connectivity checker

### Contacts manager

### Countdown timer / Stop watch

### Dashboard

This app should resemble an HR type dashboard where a user can login and view information about the company. It can have an Employee section that shows the information of that employee like Name, Address, Phone, Email, position in company, how long they have been employed, start date, vacation time remaining etc. The app should also have some sort of project tracking. You could include in some graphs and charts that show company progress year over year. One more thing would be to add a place for the HR person to make a company wide announcement that would show up on the company intranet.

### Dedicated Compass

### Diet tracker

### Docker Client

### Employee manager

### eReader

### Fantasy football

### File sharing app

### Flashlight

### Gallery or Portfolio app

### Gift app (find gifts for friends)

### GitHub API client

### Github notifications app

### Google/Chrome/Android developer video search app

### Guitar Tabs

### Guitar tuner

### Guitar/stringed instrument chord finder

### Gym Keeper (Sets / Rep Counter)

### Hacker News API/search client

### Hand Gesture Detector/Translator

An app that will use device camera as input, detect a person's gestures & movements and translate them into meaningful work i.e. perform some actions based on detected hand gestures. Best use case would be using it for teaching new things to toddlers with sounds and animations. Also, it can make understanding and interaction easier with deaf-dumb people.

### Hangman

### House search app targeting family needs

### Instagram client

### Kanban board

### Kids' milestones tracker

### Language Translator (think Google Translate)

### Mail client

### Movie Reviews

### Movies / IMDB search

### National Rail

### Nearby (transport, cafes, anything)

### News reader (e.g RSS reader)

### Note taking app

### Offline book reader

### Pedometer

### Photo booth

### Photo Cropper

### Photo sharing app

### Pizza order composer

Stores people's preferences of toppings, and maybe crust styles too, i.e., what they like, love, dislike, hate, or are neutral to. (Alternate idea: store only the device owner's preferences, and several instances can communicate with each other to collaborate, filling in other people on an ad-hoc basis.) To put together an order, say who's there and how hungry. It should put together an order that will feed everybody, maximize happiness with the toppings, and minimize price. E.g., "1 medium half-pepperoni half-mushroom plus 2 large Hawaiians". It could get prices, and maybe locations, from assorted online sources TBD, or just make assumptions.

### Planning Poker Cards

### Podcast player

### Pomodoro App

### Product Hunt API/search client

### QR Code Scanner

### Quiz/trivia app

### Quotes app

### Recipes app

### Reddit client

### Reminders app

### Runkeeper

### Safe Distance
During the Covid19 pandemic, this Android-based application has a feature to remind us to maintain a safe distance from other people. The way this application works is by scanning the distance between gadgets using the bluetooth feature, and giving notifications when the distance is too close with other people.

### Simple game (e.g cards or LetterPress)

### Snap and share client (Camera app, share to Drive)

### Speed Test app

### Spirit Level

### Stack Exchange Client

### Sticky App

### Stock Portfolio Tracker

### Surf App

Let the user register his location and then give reports showing which beaches are the best to surf in the next days. It's a good oportunity to use weather API's for something more specific.

### Tic-tac-toe

### Timetable app

### ToDo List (Classic)

### Travel app

### Trello API client

### Tunes / Music finder / player

### Twitter client

### Typing test

### URL shortener

This will take in a full URL (https://foo.bar) and return it in a string that contains 8 alpha-numeric (A-Z, 0-9) that will represent a shorten URL. You should put in guard functions to prevent any kind of SQL injection type attack.

### Vine

### Weather app

### Whatâ€™s near me? (Google Maps API)

### WhatsApp Style Messaging App

### Wine cellar (wine manager)
A manager at a high end restaurant needs an app to help manage the restaurants collection of (x) bottles of wine. The manager would like to know the vineyard, location, year, style, location in cellar, how many bottles remain, selling price, buying price, as well as tasting notes. All fields need to be updatable as prices, tasting notes and years will all change frequently. It should have an image of the label/bottle as well. 

### Working parents dinner app

### YouTube API/search client

Using the YouTube API, your app should be able to take in a search string and return the videos for that search. For example, if I wanted to watch David Bowie's Starman, it should return just those videos. However, if I'm not being picky and just want to listen to David Bowie, it should return any number of results that pertain to Bowie. An added feature would be able to have it choose at random what video is returned, or limit how many results are returned in one search.
